description: A Helm chart for Kafka

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.1.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
appVersion: "1.16.0"

  ##openshift always complains the ssc issue with:

  ##create Pod frdemo-chart-postgresql-0 in StatefulSet frdemo-chart-postgresql failed error:
  ## pods "frdemo-chart-postgresql-0" is forbidden: unable to validate against any security context constraint:
  ## [provider "anyuid": Forbidden: not usable by user or serviceaccount,
  ## provider "pipelines-scc": Forbidden: not usable by user or serviceaccount,"
  ##
  ## From google, this can be an workaround by adding some policy :
  ## oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n yournamespace
  ##
  ## We can't execute this grant in openshift dev sandbox env, so we create this local chart.
  ## This localpostgresql chart still uses a pod to server request instead of creating any StatefulSet.
  ## this makes it simple and can be deployed to openshift dev sandbox
